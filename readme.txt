== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do we use this thing? =

You simply use the `cozimo` tag within your posts. For example, the following tag:

`[cozimo filename="http://path/to/file.flv" /]`

will display the video file identified by the `filename` within Cozimo's Interactive Collaboration Environment (ICE).

= Is that all it takes? =

That's it! You may also define `width` and `height` parameters to the tag, as well as `bgcolor`.

For a complete listing of options, bells and whistles, visit the plugin site at `http://www.cozimo.com/wordpress`.

== Known Issues ==

* The Color Picker Tool only works with locally stored content (that is, images or videos stored in your blog server).
* This plugin is in beta and evolving fast, so come back often!

== Screenshots ==
